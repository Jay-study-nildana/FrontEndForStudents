# Essential Libraries

Building an app in react means, using a lot of libraries. There must thousands of them.

Still, in this page, I have listed some common libraries that you will be using all the time. Usually, you can simply look at package.json of any of my demo projects, and see what happens you need to use. 

Or, you could just clone any of my projects, and simply practice on top of it.

1. react-redux
1. redux
1. redux-devtools-extension
1. redux-persist
1. reselect
1. styled-components
