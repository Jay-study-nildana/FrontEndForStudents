# Essential Libraries

Building an app in react means, using a lot of libraries. There must thousands of them.

Still, in this page, I have listed some common libraries that you will be using all the time

1. https://github.com/remix-run/react-router - used for routing. You see, unlike standard HTML, React JS does not have a routing option.
1. react-redux
1. redux
1. redux-devtools-extension
1. redux-persist
1. reselect
1. styled-components
1. redux-thunk
