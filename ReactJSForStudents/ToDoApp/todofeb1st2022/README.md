# hello world todo list react js web app

Code that I built while walking myself through the 'Building Modern Projects with React' course on linked in.

Note : Dont forget to run the companion server app, 'react-ecosystems-server'

# Key Topics Covered Here

As always, the goal is 'separation of concern'. Decoupling.

1. React Proper
1. Redux - State Management
1. Side Effects - Getting Data for web api
1. Redux Thunk - Helps with Side Effects Management.
1. Selectors - hide away state and state data.
1. Styled Components - css in js.
1. Testing - Skipped for now. This should be learnt as a separate topic. Perhaps, in conjunction with TypeScript.

# Future

1. One should look into adding TypeScript.
1. One should look at TDD with Testing. Perhaps using Moca and Chai. Or any other suitable testing libraries.

# Other Notes

1. There are no/less .css files because, we have replaced them with css in js using styled components.

# General Notes - Running

```

    npm start
        Starts the development server.

    npm run build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

    npm test
        Starts the test runner.

    npm run eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd helloworld
    npm start

```
