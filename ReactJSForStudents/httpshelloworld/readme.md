# React JS Hello World Project with https

![image info](RandomStuffGeneratorReactApp.png)

Note : If you are just starting with React JS, I would recommend, trying this link. [create-react-app, Hello World, 2022 edition](https://medium.com/projectwt/create-react-app-hello-world-2022-edition-f36275a0e7c4)

Note : Firefox might complain that there is a security risk. Dont get scared by this. you self created this certificate. So, obviously, browsers like Firefox will complain. Click on Advanced and accept the risk and continue.

# Local host running 

1. Local:            https://localhost:3000
1. On Your Network:  https://192.168.29.208:3000

Note : When doing react JS, I would strongly recommending using two computers. One computer for coding. One computer for debugging over a network. Or, you can have two monitors.

# Setting Up Project and Running

```
    npm install
    npm start

```

1. npm install. Installs all neccessary node modules. 
1. npm start

# Notes - General

1. I have put comments and console logs (caveman debugging) all over the place. ensure you have console open when you are running the app.
