# adding a new component

This is the flow to add a new endpoint, in a new view component. 

For example, say, you have a new API endpoint that you want to start consuming and showing the data in this app. 

# Step One - actions.js

Update your actions.

# Step Two - reducers.js

update state stuff.

Note : If you are existing reducer, then, it's all good. However, if you are creating a new reducer, then, ensure, it is included in the 'store.js' file. 

Otherwise, redux won't know about your new thing.

# Step Three - thunks.js

this is where you put the fetch code. This where you write the GET AND POST stuff.

# Step Four - selectors.js

this is the filtering step. Right now, nothing to filter, but we have it. let's use it.

# Step Five - build your view component

Now, everything is ready. build your react component.

1. import everything you need first.
1. Then, map all the props.
1. Then, build the actual component.
