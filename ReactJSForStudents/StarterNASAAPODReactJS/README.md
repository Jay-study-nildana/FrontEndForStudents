# Notes - About NASA APOD API Consumption

1. The NASA api consumption code is in the folder 'NASAAPOD'. It is what I like to call a 'standalone' folder. In the sense, it is self contained. If you choose to consume another API, remember to make it self contained as well. 
1. I have also put some images, along with the source code, just to show some images, even if the internet is down for some reason.

# Notes - General

1. I have put comments and console logs (caveman debugging) all over the place. ensure you have console open when you are running the app. 
1. I am not great shakes in front end. This wont help you land an awesome front end job. However, it will help you with your internship, or perhaps, your first job. 
1. Also look at [addnewcomponents.md](addnewcomponents.md).
1. This project is a 'extraced' out of my other project, that shows how to consume APIs with Authentication along with OAuth2 Auth0.
