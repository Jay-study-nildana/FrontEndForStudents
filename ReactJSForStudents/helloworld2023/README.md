# general notes

Shows the following basic things about react.

1. How to create a brand new react js project.
1. using bootstrap via react-bootstrap
1. created new components
1. passing objects between components
1. showing image
1. created new components in folders. 
1. take input and show text output 
1. console logging
1. using buttons
1. using react-router to create routes and basic navigation with menu

Note : After looking at this, I would strongly recommend, you look at this. [React JS Starter â€” Consumes NASA APOD API with Redux and Thunks](https://medium.com/p/e21e138a8b49). This will show you how to use redux and consuming web apis.

# Local host running 

1. Local:            http://localhost:3000
1. On Your Network:  http://192.168.29.208:3000

Note : When doing react JS, I would strongly recommending using two computers. One computer for coding. One computer for debugging over a network. Or, you can have two monitors.

# Setting Up Project and Running

```
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start

```

1. npm install. Installs all neccessary node modules. 
1. npm start

# Notes - General

1. I have put comments and console logs (caveman debugging) all over the place. ensure you have console open when you are running the app. 
1. This is basic react js without any extra libraries installed.
1. So, there is no routing or anything. just a standard and true, 'single page application'. There is only one page and nothing else.
1. Note how, some components look like this. (starting with curly braces)
    ```
        const ShowSomeStuff = ({someObject1,someObject2}) => {
    ```
1. and other components look like this. (starting with small brackets)
    ```
        const ShowImageAgain = () => (
    ```
1. Aim to have something like this, without too many warnings in the terminal console.
    ```
    Compiled successfully!

    You can now view helloworld in the browser.

    Local:            http://localhost:3000
    On Your Network:  http://192.168.29.208:3000

    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use npm run build.

    webpack compiled successfully
