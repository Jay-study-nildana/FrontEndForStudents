# React JS Hello World Project with google login

![image info](RandomStuffGeneratorReactApp.png)

Note : If you are just starting with React JS, I would recommend, trying this link. [create-react-app, Hello World, 2022 edition](https://medium.com/projectwt/create-react-app-hello-world-2022-edition-f36275a0e7c4)

Note : Firefox might complain that there is a security risk. Dont get scared by this. you self created this certificate. So, obviously, browsers like Firefox will complain. Click on Advanced and accept the risk and continue.

Note : please remember that the google login library is designed to work for older versions of react. check the two files.

1. package.json
1. index.js 

to see the changes you have to make to get it to work.

Note: get api, from here, https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard.

# mkcert Usage

In order to get this project to run, you must ensure, that you install the local certificate. Check the reference section for more details.

The certs that you create, must match the following line from package.json.

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "set HTTPS=true&&set SSL_CRT_FILE=./.cert/cert.pem&&set SSL_KEY_FILE=./.cert/key.pem&&react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },    
```

# googleconfig.json file

Please create a file called 'googleconfig.json' in your 'src' folder. 

And, fill it up with the following values from your google app app. 

```
    {
        "appID": "appidputhere"
    }
```

# 'popup_closed_by_user' error

Google has recently upgraded their libraries for logging in. you will get errors. 

as mentioned before, this library is old. That is why, we need to use the 'gapi' library as a quick fix.

```
    gapi.load('client:auth2', () => {
        gapi.client.init({
            clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,
            plugin_name: 'chat',
        });
    });
```

# google profile image.

There is an issue with the google image. For whatever reason, it sometimes does not work. I have done the best I can, but, I dont know what I am missing. So, do keep this in mind.

# refresh = logout

the fblogin does not auto log you out. However, google might log out when you refresh. 

# Local host running 

1. Local:            https://localhost:3000
1. On Your Network:  https://192.168.29.208:3000

Note : When doing react JS, I would strongly recommending using two computers. One computer for coding. One computer for debugging over a network. Or, you can have two monitors.

# Setting Up Project and Running

```
    npm install
    npm install react-google-login
    npm install gapi-script
    npm start

```

1. npm install. Installs all neccessary node modules. 
1. npm install react-google-login. install the google login component.
1. npm install gapi-script. install the gapi script. this helps old google code, like the login library we are using, to work with the new google library. 
1. npm start

# Notes - General

1. I have put comments and console logs (caveman debugging) all over the place. ensure you have console open when you are running the app.
