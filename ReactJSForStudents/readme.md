# React JS For Students

some React JS related code for my students.

Also look at [DevelopmentFlow.md](DevelopmentFlow.md).
Also look at [References.md](References.md).
Also look at [commonproblems.md](commonproblems.md).
Also look at [essentiallibraries.md](essentiallibraries.md).

Note : If you end up using the Auth0 React Sample, like I do, please remember that the 'auth_config.json' file wont get committed to your github account. So, just remember to back it up manually. Or, remove it from .gitignore.
