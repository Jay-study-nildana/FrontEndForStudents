A simple react js project with tailwind configured. Showcases the following concepts.

1. Tailwind fundamentals
1. Layout basics: display, box model, spacing
1. Flexbox & Grid
1. Responsive design
1. Typography
1. Buttons, states, and variants
1. Forms and inputs
1. Cards, lists, and content components
1. Navigation patterns
1. Modals, tooltips, popovers, dropdowns
1. Images, icons, and media
1. animations, transitions, and motion
1. Theming & dark mode (Bug. Not working as of now) TODO.
  1. I tried hours and hours, however, there seems to be some major issues with getting dark mode, light mode to work in tailwind 4.X. Eventually, I had to give up. 
  1. However, I have added a dark mode light mode, working demo, which uses tailwind 3.X, where I did not encounter any issues.
1. State-driven classes
