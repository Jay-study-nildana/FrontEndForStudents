# Showcases the following concepts

1. Using React
1. Using Redux
1. Using Selector
1. Using Auth0 SDK
1. MUI UI components
1. Consuming Web API with and without Authentication

# Setting Up Project and Running

1. configure Auth0 details in 'auth_config.json'
1. npm install
1. npm start

# Notes

1. I have put comments and console logs (caveman debugging) all over the place. ensure you have console open when you are running the app. 
1. I am not great shakes in front end. This wont help you land an awesome front end job. However, it will help you with your internship, or perhaps, your first job. 
1. Also look at [addnewcomponents.md](addnewcomponents.md).
