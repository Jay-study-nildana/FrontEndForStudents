          <ul>
            <li><strong>Adam Westing: </strong> Adam Westing is a form of Self-Parody where actors play either themselves, or a Captain Ersatz of themselves, or a Captain Ersatz of their most famous role, and they play it as a total Jerkass, a total idiot, or both. More rarely, they play the character as the exact opposite of what they're most famous for, but still a Jerkass and an idiot. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bat Deduction: </strong>This is when a character makes a huge jump to reach a conclusion, often through a mental Wiki Walk, that has to be made in order for the plot to progress, but without any real explanation for what might have spurred the conclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bat Family Crossover</strong>A lesser version of the Crisis Crossover, but bigger than a regular Crossover, is the Bat Family Crossover, which typically occurs around a group of titles that are related by the heroes appearing in them or the location in which they take place.
