console.log("Hello World");

//JS is case sensitive

var hello = "hello";
var Hello = "hello";

//lets try camelCase
//recommended naming convention
//but it is up to you follow it.

var jarJarBinks = "nut case but quiet lucky";

// let jarJarBinks = "will this work" //will give you error because name is already used

var jarJarBinks = "funny toy seller"; //this won't give error.

//so, why use var or let and why and when is the question?

const prometheusFire = 12;

// prometheusFire++; //this will give error
