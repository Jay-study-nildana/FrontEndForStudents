# Electron JS For Students

I am spending more time with JavaScript and related front end technologies lately. 

Especially P5.JS.

I wanted to distribute my P5.JS and similar 'apps' on the Windows and Mac App Store. 

This contains some sample code for my students I learnt myself. It contains bare bone stuff, just enough to help me publish and distirbute my web apps.
