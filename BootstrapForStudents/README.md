# Modified Projects

These are the projects that I have modified as part of my own practice, and have made available for my students.

1. [PhotoX](PhotoX) - This was the very first project I remixed. So, this contains the maximum amount of detail in terms of comments and explanations. If you are learning CSS, start with this project. It has the maximum number of comments.
1. [Admin Dashboard](AdminDashboard) - This was the second project I remixed. It contains less comments than PhotoX. Better to go through this after PhotoX.

My belief is, if you can understand the code inside the project [PhotoX](PhotoX), interpret each line, and make meaningful remixes of the code and give it your own, customized look, you are good to go.

# Note To Students

1. Bootstrap is one of those things that is commonly used. That means, you will find a lot of ready to use code on the internet. You can also buy or download ready to use themes.
1. The important thing to remember, from my own experience of learning bootstrap, is that, it will probably takes years to write bootstrap code without using existing code samples. 
1. So, my advice is to use existing code, try and understand the different CSS and bootstrap code used, and then, keep remixing and learn. 
1. It will happen slowly, so, be patient.

# Bootstrap Version

Currently, the code is built on top of Bootstrap 4.X.

# Starter Template

# Personal Note

I have always had a huge problem with CSS and Bootstrap and Responsive Design all my life. I found, George Lomidze tutorials, which I watched via my learning.oreilly.com subscription, very useful.
