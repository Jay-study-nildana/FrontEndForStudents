# Note To Students

1. Bootstrap is one of those things that is commonly used. That means, you will find a lot of ready to use code on the internet. You can also buy or download ready to use themes.
1. The important thing to remember, from my own experience of learning bootstrap, is that, it will probably takes years to write bootstrap code without using existing code samples. 
1. So, my advice is to use existing code, try and understand the different CSS and bootstrap code used, and then, keep remixing and learn. 
1. It will happen slowly, so, be patient.

# Personal Note

I have always had a huge problem with CSS and Bootstrap and Responsive Design all my life. I found, George Lomidze tutorials, which I watched via my learning.oreilly.com subscription, very useful.
