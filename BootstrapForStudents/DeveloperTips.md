# Emmet Shortcuts

1. Press . for classes
2. Press Alt/Option to multiselect

# Bootstrap Snippets

VS Code has many 'bootstrap snippet' extensions. Use them to insert ready to use bootstrap snippets. Or simply copy snippets from existing sample projects. 

Remember, you cannot remember the entire bootstrap library. No shame in copying as long as you understand what you are copying.

# Screen and Window Setup - Super Serious setup

These are additional steps on top of advice already available in the section '# Screen and Window Setup'

1. If possible, have a 3 monitor setup. 
1. Monitor 1 - half to see bootstrap tutorials, videos and stackoverflow, my code and so on.
1. Monitor 1 - other half for seeing the 'responsive design' mobile view of the code output.
1. Monitor 2 (center monitor) - for coding with split view on Visual Studio Code.
1. Monitor 3 (left monitor) - for seeing the full, desktop view of the code output.

# Screen and Window Setup

1. During development, ensure that you have at least 2 monitors. 
2. On the main (probably big) monitor, you keep 80 % of your screen for VS Code. 
3. On the same main monitor, 20 % (usually on the right side), you keep a small browser window, which is showing the bootstrap code you are right. This wil show you the view, as it will look, on a smartphone, the sm breakpoint on bootstrap.
4. On the second (perhaps, smaller monitor), you keep a browser open at maximized, to see a preview of your code on desktop. 
5. Since both Vanilla JS and Next JS, have live reload/hot reload, as you work, you will be able to see the output without having to constantly switching your coding window.
1. Extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey for live seeing of output
2. Two Monitors. Big monitor for showing VS Code Plus mobile size browser to the right of VS Code. Second smaller monitor with browser maximized. That way I can see both desktop and mobile previews at the same time. 
3. VS Code has Emmet built in.
4. Bootstrap 5 is out. so, if something is not working, see if the code has changed in bootstrap docs.
5. bootstrap-npm-starter is available but that only works with bootstrap 4.X. So, not sure we can use that straightaway. As of now, Live Server by Ritwick Dey is the best option. 
6. If you are using a 2K or 4K monitor, remember to turn off sclaing. This will allow you to preview things properly. Otherwise, the windows scaling will keep changin the actual size of the website, making you think that your code is wrong.
