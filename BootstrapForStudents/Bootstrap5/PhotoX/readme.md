# PhotoX

I have taken the original Photo X project by George Lomidze and have made my own modifications and upgrades.

This was the very first project I remixed. So, this contains the maximum amount of detail in terms of comments and explanations. If you are learning CSS, start with this project.

# Note To Students

1. Bootstrap is one of those things that is commonly used. That means, you will find a lot of ready to use code on the internet. You can also buy or download ready to use themes.
1. The important thing to remember, from my own experience of learning bootstrap, is that, it will probably takes years to write bootstrap code without using existing code samples. 
1. So, my advice is to use existing code, try and understand the different CSS and bootstrap code used, and then, keep remixing and learn. 
1. It will happen slowly, so, be patient.
