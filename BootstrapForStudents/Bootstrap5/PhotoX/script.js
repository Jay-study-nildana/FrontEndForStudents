//Note to students. I am intentionally avoiding using javascript and jquery for css related visual tricks.
//I want to keep my bootstrap not dependent on js file 
//if some visual website thing cannot be done without jquery or js, better to not use it all
//this is because, eventually, i wish to rebuild all this code in react js. react js does not allow js based modifications
