# Bootstrap 5 Demo Projects

These are the projects that I have modified as part of my own practice, and have made available for my students.

Please note that, my changes are cosmetic at best. A image change, some text change there. The purpose to show that, my students, after the basic training of bootstrap can remix them at a surface level. As always, I am only interested in teaching the basics.

# StartBootstrap Projects Remixed

1. [startbootstrap-sb-admin](startbootstrap-sb-admin) - This is a simple admin dashboard. As usual, I have remixed with my own changes.
1. [startbootstrap-freelancer](startbootstrap-freelancer) - A simple freelancer theme. remixed as usual.

# George Lomidze Projects Remixed

This is essentially the 4.X projects that were updated to work with the new Boostrap 5.0 by me.

1. [PhotoX](PhotoX) - This was the very first project I remixed. So, this contains the maximum amount of detail in terms of comments and explanations. If you are learning CSS, start with this project. It has the maximum number of comments.
1. [Admin Dashboard](AdminDashboard) - This was the second project I remixed. It contains less comments than PhotoX. Better to go through this after PhotoX.

My belief is, if you can understand the code inside the project [PhotoX](PhotoX), interpret each line, and make meaningful remixes of the code and give it your own, customized look, you are good to go.

# Upgrading from 4.X to 5.X

Note : This only applies to the George Lomidze Projects Remixed. Other projects were already Bootstrap5 when I started remixing them.

The entire process of upgrading from 4.X to 5.X was almost 90 % without problems.

1. The navbar stopped working. I had to rebuild it by using the navbar example on the bootstrap 5.X documentation.
1. Also, in the admin dashboard, the sidebar, simply stopped working. I tried to fix it, but, I couldn't. So, I had to get rid of it.

# Starter Projects

1. [Bootstrap5TemplateStarter](Bootstrap5TemplateStarter) - starter project.
