# Todo

My personal todo list.

I plan to keep experimenting with this code, keep making more and more changes as time goes on. I mean, bootstrap 5 only now showed up, and it's not going anywhere.

and, things like coding tutoring never really end.

# Things To Do

1. In datatable2.pug, can be build some kind of a random batman people generator? and make the table populate from that?
1. Could we include more elements, borrowed from the main bootstrap website?
1. The cards don't do anything yet. Like the Villains and Justice League card. Like when you click on "View Detailed Files". could you put some actual content in them?
1. Also, a lot of strings are hardcoded. could we export data from a json file or json object, and fill up the entire website?

# Hobbies

I try to maintain a few hobbies.

1. Podcasting. You can listen to my [podcast here](https://stories.thechalakas.com/listen-to-podcast/).
