# Start Bootstrap - Freelancer

As usual, I am always prowling around on github, finding more open source projects that I can use to teach my students.

This is one of them.

# General Notes

1. clone the entire repo, from the startbootstrap source, when starting over. remember to do 'npm install' before you do anything with the code.
1. I usually delete - .editorconfig, .gitignore, LICENSE and README.MD files. You can keep them if you want. Most of these files I usually create on my own.
1. This template uses a technology called 'pug' to generate the HTML.
1. 'npm run' like how you do in React JS, runs the website in a browser with live reloading, just like React JS.
1. more npm options are available in package.json.

# Other Things

1. Remember that pug uses a 'indentation' based coding system. You miss an indentation, you miss the code and it wont work.
