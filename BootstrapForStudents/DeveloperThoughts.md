# Developer Thoughts

Some general thoughts I have jotted down as I practised Bootstrap.

# Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5

I have been thinking about this. 5 just came out of beta a few months ago (as I type this in April 2021). Most of the support and tutorials is for Bootstrap 4.

The tutorial by George Lomidze is also 4. 

The official bootstrap starter template is also 4.

So, we are sticking to 4 for now. 

Eventually, I will upgrade the code to 5, or perhaps, open up a new branch for bootstrap 5. <- TODO
