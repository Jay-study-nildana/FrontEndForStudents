# Font Awesome - Using it Locally

It is possible to serve fonts directly from the font awesome servers. That comes with limitations. Better to use it locally.

1. The /css/all.css file contains the core styling plus all of the icon styles that you’ll need when using Font Awesome. The /webfonts folder contains all of the typeface files that the above CSS references and depends on.

1. Copy the entire /webfonts folder and the /css/all.css into your project’s static assets directory (or where ever you prefer to keep front end assets or vendor stuff).

1. Add a reference to the copied /css/all.css file into the <head> of each template or page that you want to use Font Awesome on.

```
    <head>
    <link href="/your-path-to-fontawesome/css/all.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!--load all styles -->
    </head>
    <body>
    <i class="fas fa-user"></i> <!-- uses solid style -->
    <i class="far fa-user"></i> <!-- uses regular style -->
    <i class="fal fa-user"></i> <!-- uses light style -->
    <!--brand icon-->
    <i class="fab fa-github-square"></i> <!-- uses brands style -->
    </body>

```
