# Bootstrap 4 Demo Projects

These are the projects that I have modified as part of my own practice, and have made available for my students.

1. [PhotoX](PhotoX) - This was the very first project I remixed. So, this contains the maximum amount of detail in terms of comments and explanations. If you are learning CSS, start with this project. It has the maximum number of comments.
1. [Admin Dashboard](AdminDashboard) - This was the second project I remixed. It contains less comments than PhotoX. Better to go through this after PhotoX.

My belief is, if you can understand the code inside the project [PhotoX](PhotoX), interpret each line, and make meaningful remixes of the code and give it your own, customized look, you are good to go.
