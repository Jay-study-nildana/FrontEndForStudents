# Full Stack Notes Project

This is what this project, front end and backend combo, demonstrate.

1. Prisma + Postgres CRUD controller demonstrating Create/Read/Update/Delete.
1. Auth endpoints: register and login that issue JWTs containing role claims.
1. Role-based access enforced in Express via middleware (authenticate + requireRole).
1. Route-level gating (router.use, per-route middleware) with controller functions focused on business logic.
1. Simple token-only approach (JWT carries roles) — clear and easy to explain.

This is a good project for first time developers to build a full stack project with NodeJS/Express and React JS. 

After this, they con keep building more complex full stack projects. Or, they can move on to using frameworks like NextJS and NestJS.
