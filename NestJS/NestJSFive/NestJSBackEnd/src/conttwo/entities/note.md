Notes / important details

    The Nest "entities" folder generated by the CLI is mainly useful when you use TypeORM. With Prisma you don't need TypeORM entities; you can either:
        Repurpose the entities file as a plain class to help Swagger show response schemas (as above), or
        Remove it and use Prisma types and DTOs only.
